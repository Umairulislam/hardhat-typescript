        <h3 className="text-black dark:text-white font-semibold">TIP</h3>
        <p className="mt-2">
          If you are using Windows, we strongly recommend using <u>WSL 2</u> to follow this guide.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        We will explore the basics of creating a Hardhat project with a sample contract, tests of
        that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module to deploy it.
      </p>
      <p>To create the sample project, run npx hardhat init in your project folder:</p>
      <CodeSnippet code={snippet1} language="bash" />
      <p>
        Let‚Äôs create the JavaScript or TypeScript project and go through these steps to compile,
        test and deploy the sample contract. We recommend using TypeScript, but if you are not
        familiar with it just pick JavaScript.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold"> Runnig Tasks</h2>
      <p>
        To first get a quick sense of what's available and what's going on, run npx hardhat in your
        project folder:
      </p>
      <CodeSnippet code={snippet2} language="bash" />
      <p>
        The list of available tasks includes the built-in ones and also those that came with any
        installed plugins. npx hardhat is your starting point to find out what tasks are available
        to run.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Compiling your contracts</h3>
      <p>Next, if you take a look in the contracts/ folder, you'll see Lock.sol:</p>
      <CodeSnippet code={snippet3} language="solidity" />
      <p>To compile it, simply run:</p>
      <CodeSnippet code={snippet4} language="javascript" />
      <p>
        If you created a TypeScript project, this task will also generate TypeScript bindings using
        <u>TypeChain</u>.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold">Test your contracts</h4>
      <p>
        Your project comes with tests that use <u>Mocha</u>, <u>Chai</u>, <u>Ether.js</u> and{" "}
        <u>hardhat Ignition</u>.
      </p>
      <p>If you take a look in the test/ folder, you'll see a test file:</p>
      <CodeSnippet code={snippet5} language="javascript" />
      <p>You can run your tests with npx hardhat test:</p>
      <CodeSnippet code={snippet6} language="bash" />

      <h5 className="text-xl font-semibold">Deploying your contract</h5>
      <p>Next, to deploy the contract we will use a Hardhat Ignition module.</p>
      <p>Inside the ignition/modules folder you will find a file with the following code:</p>
      <CodeSnippet code={snippet7} language="javascript" />
      <p>You can deploy it using npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js:</p>
      <CodeSnippet code={snippet8} language="" />
      <p>
        To learn more check out the <u>Hardhat Ignition documentation</u>.
      </p>

      <h6 className="text-xl font-semibold">Connecting a wallet or Dapp to Hardhat Network</h6>
      <p>
        By default, Hardhat will spin up a new in-memory instance of Hardhat Network on startup.
        It's also possible to run Hardhat Network in a standalone fashion so that external clients
        can connect to it. This could be a wallet, your Dapp front-end, or a Hardhat Ignition
        deployment.
      </p>
      <p>To run Hardhat Network in this way, run npx hardhat node:</p>
      <CodeSnippet code={snippet9} language="bash" />
      <p>
        This will expose a JSON-RPC interface to Hardhat Network. To use it connect your wallet or
        application to http://127.0.0.1:8545.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to connect Hardhat to this node, for example to run a deployment against it, you
        simply need to run it using --network localhost.
      </p>
      <p>
        To try this, start a node with npx hardhat node and re-run the deployment using the network
        option:
      </p>
      <CodeSnippet code={snippet10} language="bash" />
      <p>
        To run Hardhat Network on specific port and allow incoming requests from a specific network
        interface or hostname, run <code>npx hardhat node --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 8545</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to allow incoming requests from anywhere, including external ips, use --hostname
        0.0.0.0.
      </p>
      <p>
        Congrats! You have created a project and compiled, tested and deployed a smart contract.
